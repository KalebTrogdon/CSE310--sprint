# Overview

I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and explore new programming languages. In this project, I've written software in R to demonstrate my understanding of the language and its capabilities for data analysis and manipulation.

The software I've developed is a data cleaning and preprocessing script in R. It reads in a dataset, performs various cleaning and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering

The purpose of writing this software is to deepen my understanding of R programming and its applications in data science and analysis. 

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code provides excellent support for R programming with extensions such as R Extension Pack, which includes features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools.

The programming language used for this project is R. In addition to the base R language, I utilized several libraries, including dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for data visualization. These libraries greatly facilitate the data cleaning and preprocessing tasks, making the code more efficient and concise.

# Future Work


1. Improve error handling and robustness of the script to handle edge cases more gracefully.
2. Add support for additional data preprocessing techniques such as imputation methods for missing values.
3. Enhance the visualization capabilities by incorporating more advanced plots and customization options.
4. Explore integration with other data analysis tools and platforms to streamline the end-to-end data analysis workflow.
